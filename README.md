My (hastily written at weird hours) solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

I'm currently using this to learn a bit of Rust. (It's very nice so far!)

## Day 1
That was a nice, cute problem to solve! I'd like to generalise the solver so you can specify the number of numbers that to be added together to make 2020 at some point.

## Day 2
Another cute problem! Spent most of the time working out how to use string operations, and Iterator methods.

## Day 3
Something about using 2D vectors instead of a jagged array but I'm too lazy.
